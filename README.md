# Pearl
PEARL (Proactive Early Awareness &amp; Readiness Layer) is an on-premise system designed to detect early signs of mental and physical fatigue in air traffic controllers (ATCOs). It combines operational data, voice analysis, and facial cues to provide real-time fatigue insights all processed locally inside a secure environment.
